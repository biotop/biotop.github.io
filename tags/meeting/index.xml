      <description>On a sunny weekend at the end of October, we gathered at Groppenstein castle near Mallnitz-Obervellach in Carinthia for our third meeting.
 We welcomed three new additions to the group: Gerhard Dorn, Dieter Gutschi, and Ugne Greivyte. We started off with a recap of recent developments regarding the Container Lab project, as well as our participation in the London Design Festival. This was followed by a discussion of future plans.</description>

      <description>The second meeting of Biotopists took place in Vienna from 17th-19th November 2017. Over the course of three days we met at Spazio Pulpo to discuss progress and plan the Biotop Christmas event. Friday evening was dedicated to catching up. People arrived from various places - quite a few Biotop members live in Vienna, others had to travel from London, Oxford, Munich, and Villach. For those who hadn&amp;rsquo;t been able to attend the first Biotop meeting in July, this was the first time they met the other members of Biotop in person.</description>

      <description>So, this happened. The first ever Biotop meeting took place in Villach last weekend (28th-30th July 2017). Around 20 people who had each individually voiced their interest in joining the Biotop family but had (bar a few exceptions) never met in person descended on our small town to forge new friendships, set up collaborations and get some projects off the ground.
 People came to Villach from various different places including London, Oxford, Munich, Vienna, Graz, Salzburg (some participants from New York and Oxford joined the meeting online) and brought expertise in a variety of backgrounds with them.</description>
