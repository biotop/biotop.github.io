      <description>DONE! And just in time! Late on Friday 15th February 2019, we submitted our entry for the &amp;ldquo;Science Comics for Kids&amp;rdquo; competition by the Austrian Academy of Sciences (Ã–AW).
Our story is about a little girl who loves to draw. One day due to a weird accident all her colours disappear. She goes on a quest to bring her colours back, and learns something about the science behind colour along the way.</description>
