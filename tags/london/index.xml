      <description>We recently had the chance to be a part of the London Design Festival, by contributing to the &amp;ldquo;Biodesign Here Now&amp;rdquo; exhibition at the OpenCell campus in Shepherd&amp;rsquo;s Bush. We installed our exhibition &amp;ldquo;See the invisible&amp;rdquo;, which we already had on display in Villach last Christmas.
 In addition, we conducted workshops in the Open Cell container lab that we designed the interior layout for and helped build back in May.</description>

      <description>We just got back from London, where we helped our friends at OpenCell furnish their first container lab.
How did this happen? Well, about a month ago we were contacted by Helene Steiner, who, together with Thomas Meany, is in the process of setting up a container village for small biotech startups in the heart of London. The idea is to provide a professional workspace (10 biolabs, 20 offices, 10 studios for artists and designers, 4 workshop containers, 1 store) to small businesses and startups.</description>
