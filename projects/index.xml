      <description>We are passionate about making science accessible. Exhibitions on scientific topics that would allow people to just &amp;ldquo;drop by&amp;rdquo; or accidentally stroll in, have been a key part of our activities.
 Thus far, we&#39;ve organised exhibitions in Villach and London and have put together a christmas calendar that bridged the virtual and the real. We design and build our exhibits ourselves and love the creative and transdisciplinary process involved in every aspect of putting an exhibition together</description>

      <title>DNA Barcoding</title>

      <description>What is DNA-barcoding?  DNA-barcoding is a method that is uses a small section of the DNA to specify an organism. The chosen section has to be unique for every species. It is called barcode because it can be assigned distinctively like a supermarket barcode to a product.
DNA stores genetic information like computercode only instead of the numbers 0 and 1 DNA uses four bases as &amp;lsquo;letters&amp;rsquo;: adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine.</description>

      <description>Comics and graphic novels are an amazing way of communicating science, and have become increasingly popular over the years. Comics tell stories in a way that&#39;s neither just picture, nor pure text and thereby engage our brains in wonderful ways.</description>
