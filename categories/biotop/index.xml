&amp;ldquo;Human Nature&amp;rdquo; is a new documentary film about the development and applications of the genome editing tool CRISPR/CAS9. This novel technology enables the precise modification of genetic material inside an organism, allowing both changes to the biosphere as well as editing of the human genome. While this method has the potential to cure many genetic diseases, it also raises a plethora of ethical questions. What exactly is &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; as opposed to &amp;ldquo;diseased&amp;rdquo;?</description>

We are surrounded by and take part in complex systems. Yet, we struggle with the consequences of complexity. The global financial system and the climate are two examples of complex systems that inevitably affect our daily lives. Due to their apparent impenetrability, they make us feel insecure.</description>

      <description>Our &amp;ldquo;advent calendar&amp;rdquo; is finally on!
Every day, another aspect of Christmas will be used to explain science and design in an exciting and entertaining way. One will be able to discover what makes snowflakes scientifically exciting, why earworms such as “Last Christmas” drill so deep into our brains, what archaeologists find fascinating about gingerbread, and how architects approach gift-wrapping.
All the content will also be on display in the shop window of our office space at Gerbergasse 3 in Villach.</description>

      <description>On a sunny weekend at the end of October, we gathered at Groppenstein castle near Mallnitz-Obervellach in Carinthia for our third meeting.
 We welcomed three new additions to the group: Gerhard Dorn, Dieter Gutschi, and Ugne Greivyte. We started off with a recap of recent developments regarding the Container Lab project, as well as our participation in the London Design Festival. This was followed by a discussion of future plans.</description>

      <description>We recently had the chance to be a part of the London Design Festival, by contributing to the &amp;ldquo;Biodesign Here Now&amp;rdquo; exhibition at the OpenCell campus in Shepherd&amp;rsquo;s Bush. We installed our exhibition &amp;ldquo;See the invisible&amp;rdquo;, which we already had on display in Villach last Christmas.
 In addition, we conducted workshops in the Open Cell container lab that we designed the interior layout for and helped build back in May.</description>

      <description>We just got back from London, where we helped our friends at OpenCell furnish their first container lab.
How did this happen? Well, about a month ago we were contacted by Helene Steiner, who, together with Thomas Meany, is in the process of setting up a container village for small biotech startups in the heart of London. The idea is to provide a professional workspace (10 biolabs, 20 offices, 10 studios for artists and designers, 4 workshop containers, 1 store) to small businesses and startups.</description>

      <description>Here we would like to give you a peek behind the scenes of how we put together our exhibition &amp;ldquo;See the invisible&amp;rdquo;. We came up with the concept and gathered together the individual contributions during our November meeting (read about it in this blog post).
Given that we all live in separate places, we had to find a good way of orangising and coordinating tasks remotely. We decided to use the project planning app &amp;ldquo;Trello&amp;rdquo; for this purpose and created an in silico plan for our exhibition.</description>

      <description>We are in the process of putting together a catalogue for our exhibition &amp;ldquo;See the invisible&amp;rdquo;, which was on display in Villach from 22/12/2017 until 3/2/2018.
Watch this space.
Meanwhile, here are some pictures of the exhibits:

      <description>The second meeting of Biotopists took place in Vienna from 17th-19th November 2017. Over the course of three days we met at Spazio Pulpo to discuss progress and plan the Biotop Christmas event. Friday evening was dedicated to catching up. People arrived from various places - quite a few Biotop members live in Vienna, others had to travel from London, Oxford, Munich, and Villach. For those who hadn&amp;rsquo;t been able to attend the first Biotop meeting in July, this was the first time they met the other members of Biotop in person.</description>

      <description>So, this happened. The first ever Biotop meeting took place in Villach last weekend (28th-30th July 2017). Around 20 people who had each individually voiced their interest in joining the Biotop family but had (bar a few exceptions) never met in person descended on our small town to forge new friendships, set up collaborations and get some projects off the ground.
 People came to Villach from various different places including London, Oxford, Munich, Vienna, Graz, Salzburg (some participants from New York and Oxford joined the meeting online) and brought expertise in a variety of backgrounds with them.</description>
